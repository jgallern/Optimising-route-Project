    "### 1. Presentation of the context\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of climate change, ADEME has launched a call for proposals focused on innovative and sustainable mobility solutions for both people and goods. The agency aims to foster experimental projects that demonstrate efficient, sustainable methods for transportation, adapted to different kind of territories and fields. This way, they aim to combat climate change by optimizing existing technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of CesiCDP, a team with a strong background in Smart Multimodal Mobility, we are a good fit to respond to this call. With our experience developing advanced transportation systems, we recognize both the potential and the challenges of new transport technologies. Although these technologies promise to be cleaner and more economical, they bring their own logistical complexities, especially in resource management. Addressing these issues in transport logistics could be transformative, not only for the industry but for the environment as well-through applications in diverse areas such as mail distribution, product delivery, road network maintenance, waste collection and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to optimize delivery routes to minimize environmental impact while increasing efficiency. Our team’s goal is to propose an algorithmic solution that computes optimal delivery routes across a road network, linking various cities and returning to the origin point. The solution will minimize the total journey time while accounting for projected traffic conditions over various time slots and perhaps trucks capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Presentation of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Problem is a typical Vehicle routing problem. The Vehicule routing is a classical problem in the field of Transportation. Our goal is to go through each given cities (delivery points) and to return to the starting point in the smallest amount of time possible.\n",
    "We could also take into consideration the opening hours of the clients as well as the capacity of the trucks (either in terms of surface or volume)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters to take as input\n",
    "list of:\n",
    "* Cities\n",
    "\t* city name\n",
    "\t* city coordinates\n",

    "### 3. Theoratical properties that we'll use and their formalisation \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to prove that our problem is NP-Complete.\n",
    "To do that, we need to demonstrate 2 things:\n",
    "* That our problem $\\in$ NP, that means that we can verify a solution in a polynomial time.\n",
    "* That our problem is at least as hard as another NP-Complete problem (here the Traveling salesman Problem, and then the Hamiltonian cycle). We do that by making a polynomial reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our problem $\\in$ NP\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that the VRP problem is np, we need to demonstrate that a solution can be verified in a polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our VRP Instance like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of $N$ client and our starting point (deposit) $D$\n",
    "* A fleet of $K$ Vehicle, with a maximal capacity $Q$ for each truck.\n",
    "* A Cost Matrix $T=(t_{ij})$ for $i,j \\in \\{ D,1,2,…,N \\}$, representing the time of the travel between each pair of client / each pair of client and the deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate solution for our problem is a set of route $R_1, R_2, ... , R_k$ for the $K$ available vehicles. Each route $R_k$ should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start from our deposit $D$\n",
    "* Respect the capacity $Q$ of the vehicle\n",
    "The $N$ Client should have been visited once\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that a candidate solution is valide, we can compute the following opération in a polynomial time:\n",
    "1. Verifying that each route $R$ starts from $D$\n",
    "2. Verifying that each client is visited once and only once\n",
    "3. Verifying that the capacity $Q$ of each vehicule is not exceeded\n",
    "4. Calculating the total cost of the routes and verifying that the constraint of cost are respected (if they are defined)\n",
    "5. Verifying that the vehicules deliver during the time slot of each city (if time slots are defined). \\\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, we can verify a candidate solution of our problem in a polynomial time. Therefore, **our VRP problem is a NP problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our problem NP-Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "We first started by trying to reduce our problem to the Travelling Salesman Problem to then reduce it to the Hamiltonian cycle. But we quickly realised that we could directly reduce our problem to the Hamiltonian cycle.\n",
    "Therefore, the reduction to the Travelling Salesman Problem is not necessary but we will still present it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to show that our problem is NP-HARD, we have to make a polynomial reduction from VRP to the *Travelling Salesman Problem*.\n",
    "As defined earlier, in the VRP, We have $K$ vehicle available with a capacity of $Q$, and we want to have a $K$ routes that goes to all the given cities. The routes must start and finish at the Deposit.\n",
    "In the Travelling Salesman Problem, we have one vehicule, we want to go to each given city and we must start and finish at the same point.\n",
    "So, to reduct our problem to the TSP, we have to say that $K=1$, that we don't care about the capacity because we have 1 salesman to transport. \n",
    "Now that $K=1$, we calculate one path that visits each city exactly once, starting and finishing at one starting point. As you can see, that is the TSP.\n",
    "All the operations we did for the reduction can be computed in a polynomial time, in other words, we can reduce our VRP problem to a TSP problem in a polynomial time. We know that the TSP problem is NP-HARD, so we can say that **our problem is NP-HARD**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reduction from VRPTW to Hamiltonian Cycle (to prove that VRPTW is at least NP-Complete)\n",
    "The Hamiltonian Cycle problem determins whether a graph contains a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. \n",
    "In our case, the VRPTW problem uses a graph and a max time as an input and returns whether it is possible to visit all the nodes in the graph in the given time.\n",
    "We will reduce the VRPTW problem to the Hamiltonian cycle problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Conditions:</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to create a graph that would work for any instance of the Hamiltonian Cycle.\n",
    "Therefore, we need to create a graph where Each vertex in the Hamiltonian graph corresponds to a customer's location (in our case, a city).\n",
    "Then, we add a node for the depot (which is both the start and end point of the route).\n",
    "We then set all the distances in the VRPTW problem as the distances between the nodes in the Hamiltonian graph.\n",
    "2. The second step is to limit the number of vehicles to 1 and to set the capacity of the truck so that it is at least equal to the sum of the demands of all the customers. This way, a single truck can ensure all the deliveries, making sure that one truck can visit all the nodes.\n",
    "3. The third step is to set the time windows of the customers. We will set the time windows of the all the customers to be the same one so that the truck can visit all the customers in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Definition:</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "VRPTW problem : Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ includes a warehouse and customer locations along with the following informations:\n",
    "* A distance $d(i, j)$ between each pair of vertices $i, j \\in V$.\n",
    "* A time window $[a_i, b_i]$ for each customer $i \\in V$.\n",
    "* Vehicle capacity $Q$.\n",
    "* a maximum route time $T$ to visit all the customers. (serves as a time limit for the Hamiltonian Cycle problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamiltonian Cycle problem : Given a graph $G'= (V', E')$, determine whether there is a cycle in $V'$ that visits each vertex exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Transformation:</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform an instance of VRPTW into an instance of HC, we need to create a graph $G'$ such that solving HC on $G'$ corresponds to solving VRPTW on $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each customer i in the VRPTW instance corresponds to a vertex $v_i$ in $G'$. We add a vertex $v_0$ to represent the warehouse.\n",
    "2. For every pair of vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ in $G'$, we include an edge with weight $d(i, j)$. The distance between two locations in the VRPTW instance is the weight of the edge between the corresponding vertices in $G'$.\n",
    "3. We set the number of vehicles to 1 and the capacity of the truck to be at least equal to the sum of the demands of all the customers. This ensures that a single truck can visit all the customers. The mathematical representation of this would be $Q \\geq \\sum_{i \\in V} demand(i)$.\n",
    "4. We set the time windows of all the customers to be the same. This way, the truck can visit all the customers in any order. The time limit for the Hamiltonian Cycle problem is set to the maximum route time $T$ in the VRPTW instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can find a Hamiltonian Cycle in $G'$, then we can find a solution to the VRPTW problem. Therefore, the VRPTW problem is at least as hard as the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, which is NP-Complete. Therefore, the VRPTW problem is at least NP-Complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Polynomial Time check:</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertices from $G'$ are directly created from $V$ in $O(|V|)$ time.\n",
    "Furthermore, the edges and weights of G' are derived from E, requiring $O(|E|)$ time.\n",
    "Setting the number of vehicles to 1 and the capacity of the truck to be at least equal to the sum of the demands of all the customers can be done in $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the transformation from $G$ to $G'$ can be done in O(|V| + |E|) time, which is polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Conclusion</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these results, we can say that the VRPTW problem is NP-Complete as it can be reduced to the Hamiltonian Cycle problem in polynomial time.\n",

    "### Best approch to solve our problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Exact Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Exact algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Branch-and-Bound** and **Branch-and-Cut:** These are common techniques in solving integer programming problems. They work well on small to moderately-sized VRPTW instances by exploring feasible routes and pruning the search tree when constraints aren’t met.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Can be used to handle the time windows and sequencing constraints by breaking the problem into subproblems. However, DP suffers from exponential growth in complexity and is usually feasible only for smaller instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP):** Formulating the VRPTW as an MILP is possible and can be solved with solvers like Gurobi or CPLEX. MILP approaches are exact but can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact Algorithm are not the most optimal way to solve the problem, they have high computational costs, so we can just use them for small to moderately sized instances (usually fewer than 100 cities)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Heuristic Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Heuristic algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Savings Algorithm:** Clarke-Wright Savings heuristic can be adapted to VRPTW by incorporating time window constraints in route merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion Heuristics:** These build routes by sequentially inserting customers, checking feasibility with time windows, and selecting the least-cost option.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sweep Algorithm:** This heuristic sorts customers based on angles from the depot and constructs routes. It’s often combined with local search for refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Search Techniques:** Common local search methods include **2-opt** and **3-opt**, where edges are rearranged for better routes. For VRPTW, additional constraints are added to respect time windows during swaps or reordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristic methods are efficient and useful for obtaining feasible, high-quality solutions quickly, especially for larger problems. Heuristics are techniques that generate good solutions quickly, though they don’t guarantee optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Metaheuristic Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Metaheuristic algorithms:\n",
    "- **Simulated Annealing (SA):** SA gradually reduces the \"temperature\" to accept fewer worsening solutions, with adjustments for VRPTW to handle infeasibilities in time windows and vehicle limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genetic Algorithms (GA):** These use crossover, mutation, and selection operators to evolve a population of routes over generations, incorporating time window feasibility in offspring generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):** ACO mimics the behavior of ants finding the shortest path and is adapted to VRPTW by modifying pheromone updates based on time window constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabu Search:** This maintains a tabu list of recently explored solutions to avoid cycling and enhances exploration by allowing temporary infeasible solutions for time windows, gradually moving towards feasible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaheuristics provide a more structured approach than heuristics and can escape local optima, exploring the solution space more thoroughly. Metaheuristics balance solution quality and computational cost and can handle larger instances, making them popular for practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Hybrid Approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining methods often leads to better results than any single method alone. Common hybrid approaches include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metaheuristic + Local Search:** Many metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms or simulated annealing, are combined with local search methods like 2-opt or 3-opt to improve the quality of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exact Methods + Heuristics:** Sometimes, heuristics generate initial solutions that are later refined with exact methods. This is beneficial when an exact solution is infeasible to achieve from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decomposition Approaches:** These divide the VRPTW into smaller subproblems (e.g., by clustering nodes) and solve each part individually, often using heuristics for initial subproblems and exact methods for refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Small instances(10-50 cities) | medium instances (50-200)  | Large instances (>200)              |\n",
    "| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Exact Algo                    | Heuristic or Metaheuristic | Metaheuristics or hybrid approaches |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application to our project\n",

    "It is said that our model needs to be \"Capable of solving large instances (several thousand cities)\"\n",
    "So the better approach would be Metaheuristic approach"
